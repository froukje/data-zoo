LINECHART="A **Linechart** is a graphical representation, which connects a series of datapoints. It is often used for time dependend data. The x-axis is then chosen to be the time. It can particulary be used to show trends over time.\nHere you can choose a variable for the x-axis, for the y-axis and an optional variable to group the data. Grouping can be useful, when you want to see the effect of the y-variable on different classes in another variable. In the default data loaded you could choose 'Potability' as grouping variable."
SCATTERPLOT="A **Scatterplot** visualizes data points using dots of two (different) numeric variables. The position of each value of the two variables on the x- and y-axis defines the value for each data point in the scatter plot. Scatter plots are used to observe relationships between variables."
HISTOGRAM="A **Histogram** shows the frequency distribution of a variable. The values are grouped into bins and each bin is represented by a bar, that indicates the number of data points within that bin."
RIDGELINE="A **Ridgeline plot** shows the distribution  of one or more numeric variables. You can either choose a set of columns in order to see their distributions vertically ordered or you can choose a variable to see the distribution for each value in the grouped column.\nFor example in the default example you can plot the distributions of the different water parameters or you can group them by the variable 'Potability'"
ERRORLINE="The errorbar aggregates over repeated values (for the x axis) and shows the mean and Percentage chosen as confidence interval for ('ci', Percentage). More information: https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/error_bars.html."
